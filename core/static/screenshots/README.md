# PWA Screenshots

Add screenshots here for the PWA install prompt. These are shown when users install the app on mobile/desktop.

## Required Files

1. **dashboard-wide.png** (1280x720)
   - Desktop/tablet view of the dashboard
   - Used for `form_factor: wide`

2. **dashboard-mobile.png** (390x844)
   - Mobile view of the dashboard
   - Used for `form_factor: narrow`

## How to Create

1. Open the app in Chrome
2. Use DevTools (F12) → Device Toolbar to set resolution
3. Take a screenshot (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Capture screenshot")
4. Save with the correct filename

## Notes

- Screenshots should show the app in a good state (dashboard with data)
- Avoid showing sensitive/personal data
- Use the school's actual branding if possible
